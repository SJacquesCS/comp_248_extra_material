Write a program which requires the user to input 4 numbers in succession.

The program will output

"The order is correct" if:
	- Number 1 is smaller than number 2, and number 2 is smaller than number 3
	- Number 4 is greater than at least one of the 3 previous numbers
	
"The order is incorrect" if any of the above scenario fails.
